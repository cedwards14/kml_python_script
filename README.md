# KML Python Script

I made this script to read a kml file and take out the lats and longs and then put them into insert statments to make things go faster. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.



### Libraries

I used these libraries for this script

```

and

```
pip install beautifulsoup4
```
